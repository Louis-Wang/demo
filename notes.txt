DEVELOP

develop new things

what about now

Repository 
- collection of all the versions of this particular project	
	- order of change
	- description of change
	- who made the change

Terminology
- Commit

Version control system
- tools to review history
- share project with others
- multiple developers in one project
- Git is recommended
	- invented by Linus Tovalds, father of Linux OS
		- over 15 million lines of code
		- every new kernel released involves 1000 developers
	- distributed version control system 
		- not centralised repository
		- everyone maintains a local repository
	- GitHub is like a social network of repository
		- can share or keep to yourself
		- can add comment, community etc
	- .git hidden folder is there to store the whole project repository

Cowboy coder
- coder who doesn't use version control
- client changes mind, so may need to manually changes,
	- if they don't want it
	- if they want it at a later 
- may need to keep track each file in diff versions
- what if need to work with another developer? merge etc?
